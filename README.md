cli tetris

visit `controls.yaml` to change controls  

since i didnt use any external libraries to assist with drawing things with CLI, you might find this code a bit hard to read  

**to play:**  

if you have git:  
```
git clone https://github.com/carpetmaker3162/cli-tetris
cd cli-tetris
python3 main.py
```

if you dont have git, download the following files manually (hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha) and put them in the same folder:  
- `main.py`  
- `utils.py`  
- `controls.yaml`  
- `screen.py`
